<h1>Land Cover Modeling</h1>
<p>Land cover modeling is conducted using up to three stages. </p>
<ol>
	<li>pixel-level unsupervised classification</li>
	<li>segment level classification and regression tree</li>
	<li>rule-based class adjustments</li>
</ol>
<p>For the 2006-2009 and 2009-2011 time intervals, only the first stage (the pixel-level classification) was employed and only for the 2009 and 2011 image dates. The 2006 data lacked a near infra-red image band, which is important for land cover modeling.</p>

<h3>Unsupervised Classification</h3>
<p>The unsupervised classification occurrs in two steps. </p>
