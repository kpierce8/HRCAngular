<h3>Segmentation</h3>

<p>Image segmentation is the process of aggregating individual pixels in a raster into discrete areas (polygons) based on a statistical assessment of homogeneity. Processing for the PSCM was completed using Trimble's eCognition v8 software . The roughly 35 billion pixels covering the terrestrial basin around Puget Sound were aggregated to about 6.6 million analysis units divided among the 19 Watershed Resource Inventory Areas. These analysis units are referred to as segments. Segments range in size depending on the level of local heterogeneity in the image source data. Segments tend to be small (&lt; 0.5 acres) in urban areas and large ( &gt; 10 acres) in areas of continuous forest.</p>
