<h2>Image Processing</h2>
<p>High resolution aerial imagery (1 m) from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) was used as the primary data source. 	These data are being widely explored for their utility in providing land-cover/land-use and change detection information. Washington has complete state NAIP data for 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2013. The state of Washington is split into 62 Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIAs) often using major river watershed boundaries that range in size from about 50,000 ha to over 700,000 ha. Georectified NAIP image data were acquired from the WA Dept. of Natural Resources in 10km x 10km tiles. </p>

<p>Individual WRIAs were used as areas of analysis and whole WRIA mosaics were created for the two time periods.  The 2006 data had three visible spectral bands and was delivered at an 18 inch resolution. The 2006 data was rescaled in Erdas Imagine to one meter to match the resolution of the 2009 data. Additionally, the 2009 data included a fourth band covering the near infra-red spectrum. A change image was generated by subtracting the 2006 three band data from the three visible bands of the 2009 data. For the 2009 data the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated using the red and infra-red bands according to  This NDVI layer provides a tool for separating areas with and without vegetation and also provides a saturating spectral measure of vegetative abundance. A 9x9 pixel simple-variance layer was calculated for the infra-red band [26]. This layer was intended to help differentiate dark homogenous crops from similarly dark forested areas when aggregated as segments. These two layers were added to the 4-band 2009 image to create a six-layer data stack for 2009. 	</p>
